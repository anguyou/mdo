<p>This is an example blog post that I'm putting together to, well, show what a blog post would look like on this fine Web establishment. I'm not sure what it will entail just yet, so I'm going to let it write itself. Let's begin, shall we?</p>
<p>I think this story begins with the urge to write again. I wrote a lot of blog posts for <a href="http://www.zurb.com">ZURB</a>, but since coming to <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, I've been virtually silent&mdash;unless you count all those Tweets, which I don't. I want to share my thoughts, learnings, photographs, code snippets, and the like.</p>
<p>Writing helps me put my thoughts together. I'm incoherent most of the time unless I take a moment to collect my thoughts and write them down. Writing is a sanity check and I welcome the challenge it presents. It's one thing to have a thought, but it's another to be able to craft that into something that's understandable to others.</p>
<h3>A Duel!</h3>
<p>It's really a challenge of self-improvement. If I do something enough, presumably I'll get better at it. Coupled with feedback from others, it's a win-win situation every time I sit down to write. That said, I don't want to limit myself to <em>just</em> writing. I envision this blog as a showcase for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thoughts on design&mdash;UI, interaction, visual</li>
  <li>Code snippets I feel are useful to others</li>
  <li>My favorite photographs</li>
  <li>Music and movie reviews</li>
  <li>And more?</li>
</ul>
<p>So based on that, keep a watchful eye on everything that I'll be sharing. And try to enjoy!</p>

<p><em>P.S. This post was done in good humor. Try not to take anything I say too seriously. #kthxbai</em></p>
