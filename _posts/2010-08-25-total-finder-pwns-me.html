title: Total Finder Pwns Me
---
<p>Holy underwear! I'm pretty pumped about this plugin for Finder. It's called <a target="_blank" href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/">Total Finder</a> and it sits right on top of your Finder.app and gives you a sweet set of features. Here's a few I'm particular interested in:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Tabbed interface</strong>&mdash;I freaking hate having a bunch of windows open in Finder, so this is great. Added bonus? It's Google Chrome style tabs. I like.</li>
	<li>Visor, a <strong>shortcut-key initiated slide-in window</strong>. That's a mouthful. Assign a shortcut key, press it, and Total Finder slides into focus.</li>
	<li>A <strong>shortcut key to toggle hidden system files</strong>, a must if you want to see .htaccess or .svn files.</li>
	<li>Dual mode, a <strong>split-pane view</strong> in a single tab allowing you to quickly compare two folders side-by-side (kind of like the awesome Transmit application).</li>
</ul>

<p>It's in alpha testing right now, but when it comes out it'll be $15. I dare say I'll be ready to throw down the cash when it's finalized.</p>
