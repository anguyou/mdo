title: "Reason #1 Banks Suck: Communication"

It's not hard to be good at communicating. It takes minimal effort to be up front and to the point with people, but I do recognize it takes time to develop those skills. Banks in generally really, really, really suck at communicating well with their customers.

Above is an email I just received from Chase. It's clear from the content of the email Chase has no respect for my time and is confident in its assumption that I'm a complete dumbass. They emailed me to tell me they sent me a message somewhere else. This is the single most annoying type of email&mdash;it's more annoying than spam.

If Chase really had their shit together here, they would send me an email telling me what they need to tell me. Instead I have to sign into their app and go to their broke-ass janky message center and read something that I probably don't need to read anyway.
