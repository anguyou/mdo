title: iTunes & The Case of the Ugly Icon
---
<p>Earlier this week Apple released iTunes 10 with a slew of UI refinements. It goes without saying that the new version leaves something to be desired for those within the design community, but I haven't heard anything from non-designers yet (I have a feeling they don't really care).</p>

<p>I won't go into the UI changes here because they're not nearly as interesting as the activity happening around the new iTunes 10 icon. Abandoning the traditional CD backdrop from their icon for the first time in nearly 10 years, Apple has stirred up some angst among designers who feel the icon is ill-suited to grace their dock.</p>

<p>So, like the creative types we are, people started creating their own versions of the icon. These icon replacements essentially fall into three categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Icons that try to improve on the execution of the icon itself</li>
	<li>Icons that branch out to try new or varied approaches</li>
	<li>And, of course, the joke icons people create "just for fun"</li>
</ul>

<p>With all the tweets coming through around these icons, I figured it would be a great idea to see just what we're dealing with and why nearly all of these replacements just won't cut it.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not an icon designer, I'm just a passionate designer who wants to call attention to the bigger problem people seem to be ignoring.</em></p>

<h2>Icons that try to improve Apple's execution</h2>

<p>The first and most prominent group of icons I've seen around (Twitter and Dribbble mostly) are ones that are sticking to the same core idea as Apple' take&mdash;the music note&mdash;but trying to improve the visual style. These icons don't take the idea anywhere meaningful and instead we're bombarded with icons with sub-Apple quality.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that I think a lot of these people are experienced icon designers doing these. This doesn't really help any either and probably makes things work. Icons are a real craft that takes a lot of attention to details and experience to be able to get right again and again. I don't have that and neither do these other folks.</p>

<p>So what are we dealing with? Let's take a look at some of the ideas circulating:</p>

<p>[IMGS OF ICONS HERE]</p>

<h2>Icons that branch out</h2>

<p>Some people are taking this opportunity to more seriously redesign the iTunes icon by changing their approach to create something new and not just trying to improve on Apple's design.</p>

<h2>iTunes is about music&mdash;or is it?</h2>

It's right in the name: iTunes is all about music, my tunes. Thing is, that was true several years ago, but today iTunes is the go-to entertainment app for OS X. It's where any Mac user goes for music, movies, TV shows, apps, books, college materials, and podcasts.

Herein lies the fundamental problem with the new iTunes icon: it's not representative of the full application. Is that a bad thing? I'm not entirely convinced it is as they're likely going for 

Apple has made a statement: CDs are dead, but music is still alive and kicking.


Lots of ppl complaining
Lots of failed attempts at restyling icon
Nothing that hits on the idea behind the icon
Not a style ppl are familiar with on OS X native apps (stamp, calendar, address book, etc)

So what's the idea with iTunes?
- music, yes, but so much more
- can the icon go beyond the name to represent true function?
- perhaps, but for now prolly not—music is sweet spot and a huge market and rev source

What ideas could work?
- speakers
- big play button
- sound waves
- just the musical note
- everything: music note, movie, book, university, app, tv show
- media room (couch?)
- theater (red velvet curtains, seats, etc)—too Front Row
