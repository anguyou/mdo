<p>Yup, that about sums it up. This weekend I undertook the task of organizing the cords behind our TV and entertainment center (and I use the term "entertainment center" in the loosest sense).</p

<p>When I was finishing up, I decided to take a quick photo and remembered I now had HDR available. I turned it on and was easily impressed with the first go around (regular on left, HDR on right).</p>

<style type="text/css">
div.hdr-comparison {
  background: #f5f5f5;
  margin: 0 0 15px;
  padding: 10px 0 0 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
  -webkit-border-radius: 3px;
}
div.hdr-comparison img {
  float: left;
  margin: 0 10px 10px 0;
  width: 235px;
  -webkit-border-radius: 3px;
}
</style>

<div class="clearfix hdr-comparison">

</div>

<p>Not bad, not blatantly obvious, and not overdone. Color me impressed! The shadows are almost entirely gone and everything is really crisp. Well done, Apple, I'll definitely keep the HDR option turned on from here on out.</p>
