<p>It's no secret that I love <a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a>&mdash;I tweet about it all the time! To keep my tunes on at all times and out of my way, I keep Rdio open with an instance of <a href="http://fluidapp.com">Fluid</a>, a stand-alone (or site-specific) browser.</p>

<p>One of my favorite features of Fluid? Custom dock icons (and user styles!) for each site-specifc browser. I've been using <a href="http://media.wilsonminer.com/share/shrapnel/fluid/rdio-fluid.png">Wilson Miner's great looking icon</a>, but something felt off to me when placed next to my Twitter icon in the dock. So, I created my own!</p>

<p>It's higher contrast, uses their logo's colors for the background gradient, and it matches my (unreleased) Twitter dock icon&mdash;yay! Give it a download!</p>
