title: Designing a Replacement iPhone Icon
---
<p>Originally I set out to just polish up the default iCaltrain app icon, but after some sketching I opted to explore some other ideas. I wanted to spice it up and do more than just refinement to the generic iconâ€”the flat train symbol could be for any train app. Caltrain trains have a bit of a unique style to them (at least to me) so I figured I'd explore that more.</p>

<p>After starting off with a very rough concept for a mix of a bullet train and the Caltrain colors, I had a pretty good idea of where I want to take things. Here are some of the sketches that led me to the final direction:</p>

<p>As you can see I considered both styles of the two main train engines that Caltrain uses daily. The style that I chose feels more modern, aerodynamic, and best of all pretty unique to Caltrain.</p>

<p>The perspective on the nose made for the biggest challenge for me. Getting the angle of the red corners and windshield were tough as they define the shape of the trains face most of all. You can see how the variations I would have taken the icon in completely differed directions. None really felt right until I went back and redrew those red corners.</p>

<p>After solidifying the general shape I moved on to the shading. The nose of the Caltrain trains aren't particularly pointy, so it was more about the shading on the sides and bottom to add depth.</p>

<p>For the final refinements I added in some flaring around the lights, textures, and a reshaped nose to give the train a more aggressive look that alludes to the bottom black section on their cabs.</p>
