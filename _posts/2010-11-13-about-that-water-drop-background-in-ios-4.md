title: About that Water Drop Background in iOS 4
---
<img src="http://www.markdotto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/iphone4-ugly-ass-background.jpg" alt="iPhone 4 with ugly background" />

<p>I absolutely hate the default background in iOS 4. When the iPhone 4 came out, I was in complete awe of the hardware designâ€”it's beautiful and a solid device to hold in your hand. That wallpaper though, what the hell was the iOS team thinking? Well, I think I know.</p>

<p><strong>What better way to get people to change their background than to make their background completely hideous?</strong> I know that sounds ridiculous, but maybe it's what they were thinking. It's the only explanation I can think for why it's there. Only a fool would think their iPhone looks amazing with water droplets all over it.</p>

<p>So, was Steve Jobs smoking crack that week when he gave the approval for that wallpaper, or was it a deliberate attempt to make people notice the background and entice them to want to change it?</p>

<p>I'll give Jobs the benefit of the doubt on this one.</p>
