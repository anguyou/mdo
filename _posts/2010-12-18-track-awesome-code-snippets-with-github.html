title: Track Awesome Code Snippets with GitHub
---
<p>I don't push code to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> at all—not yet at least. I don't code enough and I don't think I really have anything to share there either. It's a well designed product that provides an invaluable service to tons of people—hosting repositories of shared or open source code bases. It provides an entirely different service for me: tracking awesomeness.</p>

<p>It just hit me that I use GitHub like this, and it hit me like a (small) rock. How often have you searched for some awesome jQuery plugin, cool new Javascript library, application add-on, and the like? It happens nearly every time I start a new project or someone else I know asks me <em>Hey, do you know of anything that does X?</em></p>

<p>Watching repos that I use a lot or that I'd want to play with down the line makes perfect sense&mdash;and GitHub is the best tool to do it.</p>
