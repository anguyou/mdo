<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brevity">Brevity</a> is the concise and exact use of words in writing or speech&mdash;a necessary skill for designers.</p>

<p>Brevity means you are quick, accurate, and precise. As a designer, it hones your communication skills while simultaneously refining your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking">design thinking</a> skills. I was reminded of this after a long conversation about iPad's mute button on Twitter with other designers.</p>

<p>Twitter is great for brevity. At 140 characters, it makes conversations more interesting and challenging. Throughout a given conversation, one must pick a single thought (sometimes more) to express in each Tweet. Each time I found myself iterating over my Tweet for over five minutes to get it <em>just</em> right.</p>

<p>Writing in any capacity improves our ability to understand things, and for a designer, it's incredibly important to not just "do design," but to discuss and analyze design in meaningful ways. Brevity is a natural effect of design. It forces you to distill interactions and experiences down to their simplest forms.</p>

<p>It's at the heart of <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D8113BF933A05752C1A9659C8B63#h4">how stuff works</a>.</p>
