title: The Year in Review
---
<p>As you may have seen, Twitter released <a href="http://yearinreview.twitter.com">a little microsite</a> to recap some awesome stuff that happened this past year. It was a fast-paced project that we ended up scaling back quite a bit to hit our deadlines, but it was fun nonetheless. It's not my typical aesthetic, so it was a creative outlet and fun way to spice up our blog posts.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/jbrewer">Josh Brewer</a>, one of our newest designers to join the <a href="http://twitter.com/design">Twitter Design team</a>, led the charge and overall creative direction. We kept it pretty scrappy and just tried to have fun with the design. I think it worked out pretty well given the time and project constraints.</p>

<p>We have some ideas for making it even more awesome next year. 2011 is going to be huge for Twitter and I'm stoked to be a part of it.</p>
