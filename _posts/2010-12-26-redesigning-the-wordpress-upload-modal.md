title: Redesigning the WordPress Upload Modal
---
<p>I like <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo/status/18165714804285440">I like WordPress in Helvetica Neue.</a> I also would like WordPress even more if their upload modal didn't look like garbage. So, I took a crack at mocking something up in Photoshop. It's only the first state of the modal, but it captures a lot of my feedback nicely.</p>

<h2>Before</h2>
<figure>

<p>But wait, why does this suck? Well, I'll tell you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Attaching media (particularly images) and inserting them into my posts is a difficult process</li>
	<li>It <em>barely</em> resembles the visual style of the rest of WordPress</li>
	<li>It's narrow, awkwardly tall, and has really pointy corners (every other corner in WordPress is rounded)</li>
</ul>
<p>The meat of my problem with the modal comes from using media, but I'm not tackling that just yet. That's a little more work than I'm want to put in for now.</p>

<h2>After</h2>

</figure>
<p>The mockup addresses a few issues I have with the current modal's design:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Uses the same top bar style as the rest of WordPress (light gray gradient)</li>
	<li>Rounds the corners of the modal</li>
	<li>Collapses the modal's header and tabs into one horizontal bar</li>
	<li>Adds a little flair to the tabs by using a style similar to Chrome for Mac</li>
	<li>Improves spatial relationship between different elements</li>
	<li>One modal heading to rule them; instead of "Add an Image" or "Add a Video," we just have "Add Media"</li>
	<li>Adds just a hint of color by making the primary action blue, just like the Publish/Schedule button for new posts in WordPress, to reinforce what you're doing within the modal</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it. It's nothing official&mdash;just putting down an idea that was in my head. <strong>Up next?</strong> Exploring the other states of the modal. The presentation of and interactions for media files suck even more than it's general design, so that'll be a fun and rewarding follow up to this post in due time.</p>
