title: How I Use Coda
---

<p>Out of all the editors I've used to date, <a href="http://panic.com/coda">Coda</a>  has been my reigning app of choice for the better part of three years. And yes, it's been that long&mdash;v1.0.1 came out May 2, 2007!</p>
<p>I've tried a handful of other apps, but none of them surpassed the visual refinement of and core features I use daily with Coda. Espresso was pretty close, but I had my gripes (more on that another time).</p>
<p>After I tweeted a link to add a third-party <a href="https://github.com/egonSchiele/Command-Line-Coda">command line tool for opening files and folders in Coda</a> the other day, I got to thinking about why I like Coda so much. So I figured, what better place to do that then right here?</p>

<h2>Coda and me</h2>
<p>Instead of trying to convince anyone to use or even like Coda, I'm just going to jot down how I use it and let you make up your own mind. Here's the rundown:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I use the built-in FTP nearly all the time. Previously I'd rely on Transmit, but I hardly use it anymore&mdash;only for the heavy lifting. Change files, click a button, confirm, done.</li>
	<li>I can keep track of all my projects with the Sites feature, which is crazy awesome, but at times pretty slow.</li>
	<li>I save time by wrapping words and phrases with HTML tags via keyboard shortcuts&mdash;like <abbr>Ctrl+A</abbr> for an <code>a</code> tag or <abbr>Cmd+B</abbr> for <code>strong</code>&mdash;with the Wrap with Tag plugin that comes with the <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/developer/howto/plugins.php">Coda plugin examples</a>. It's essential to my workflow now.</li>
	<li>I also save time with <a href="https://github.com/sergeche/tea-for-coda">TEA for Coda</a>, which lets me write zen coding style and with the press of a keyboard shortcut (<abbr>Cmd+Shift+E</abbr>) expand it right in line. It turns <code>div.row.clearfix</code> into <code>div class="row clearfix"</code> in no time.</li>
	<li>A few other plugins come in handy every now and then, including <a href="http://kevin.glowacz.info/2008/12/coda-plugin-remove-trailing-whitespace.html">Trim Trailing Whitespace</a> (self explanatory, no?) and <a href="http://mondaybynoon.com/2008/12/15/css-tools-coda-plugin/">CSS Tools</a>, a set of handy tools for (re)formatting and (un)compressing CSS.</li>
	<li>I open files and folders faster from Terminal with the recent addition of the <a href="http://">Coda command line tool</a> (exactly like that of Textmate). That means I can open anything by typing <code>coda .</code> in Terminal.</li>
	<li>I keep useful Snippets of code in the Clips feature, but I rely on that less these days. It's great for things like long blocks of HTML and javascript, but <a href="http://www.clipmenu.com/">ClipMenu</a> has taken the forefront for most things now.</li>
	<li>I remapped "Open Quickly" to <abbr>Cmd+Ctrl+Space</abbr> (it's closer to the native Spotlight shortcut, OS X's search tool) and use it all the time to quickly open CSS files, controllers, and views from anywhere in a project.</li>
	<li>Find and Replace (across entire folders) comes in handy every now and then. Mostly it's the Find in Folder that I use, but Replace comes in handy when I need to edit lots of things quickly.</li>
	<li>Multi-line editing comes in handy a lot as well, especially for things like lists. Select the lines, hit <abbr>Cmd+Shift+B</abbr> to trigger it, and then type away and Coda will echo the same changes to every character space on every line. Neat-o, gang.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I don't use</h2>
<p>There's a lot I love, but there's also a lot I never use. I've excluded ones I use sometimes (like the built-in Terminal) and just gone for the ones I know right off the top of my head.</p>
<ul>
	<li>That search form in the top right. Why is it even there? It's <abbr>Cmd+F</abbr> or bust for me.</li>
	<li>Share. I've only ever tried it just to try it and wasn't overly impressed with the results. I could do without it being there at all.</li>
	<li>Hints. Meh, never felt compelled to turn that on. Ever.</li>
	<li>Code Navigator. I gave it a go while I was at ZURB, but never stuck to it.</li>
	<li>Books. I tried early on because I thought it was badass, but I just Google everything. If APIs and developer documentation came bundled out of the box, that'd be nice, but until then I'll stick to <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/">jquery.com</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, and the like.</li>
	<li>CSS Editor. Any developer or designer fluent with CSS doesn't need an editor like this. We need faster tools to write boatloads of awesome CSS (like Less!).</li>
</ul>

<h2>So what's to be improved?</h2>
<p>Coda 2 has to be in development at Panic, and I admit it's a nerdy dream of mine that they release it with the App Store on January 6, but until then, all I can do is sit and think about how awesome it could be. Here's what I'd be looking forward to in the next big release:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2009/02/24/hierarchies/">Fix the hierarchy</a> of the app's tools. I love Coda and have become accustomed to the interface, but it's actually kind of nonsensical. I mean, it works, but can't it work and make sense from all angles? (I know Panic has commented on this, so I'll leave it at that.)</li>
	<li>Better management of Sites. It's pretty slow for me with a few dozen sites, though the animations for opening and editing Sites are painfully slow no matter what. Make it fast, make it sexy.</li>
	<li>Git management built in, but I could take it or leave it. Using Terminal is easy enough for my purposes (read, not a lot of branches and merging) that it's usually more difficult to use a graphical interface on top of it.</li>
	<li>Autopublishing for FTP. I want Coda to track files that have been changed and push them. This should also be toggleable as the use case for this is fifty-fifty for me.</li>
	<li>Easier styling of the syntax modes. <a href="http://kodapp.com/">Kod</a> sounds uber promising with full CSS styling of it's code display, so that'd be awesome.</li>
	<li>More plugins and better browsing of them. The official plugin directory leaves much to be desired&mdash;no search, no tags, no authors, etc. Some more structure and a better browsing experience might liven up the development, too.</li>
	<li>Fullscreen editing. Something I could take or leave, but given that Coda has a preview tool and Terminal built right in, fullscreen would be awesome for hunkering down and knocking out code.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, there is a lot to love about Coda and a lot to (hopefully) look forward to with the next big release. I'd love to see a performance boost come to the app and some refinement across the core features more than anything; added features are just icing on the cake honestly.</p>
<p>Here's to hoping Panic has something big up their sleeves :).</p>
