title: Moving RSS to Feedburner
---
<p>Not sure why I didn't set it up when I was originally prompted to add the RSS feed to my site months ago, but alas, I want some metrics on my feeds and <a href="http://feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> is the only good way to do it. It's going to look like crap, but hopefully the functionality will stay around for awhile.</p>

<p>So, as a heads up, I'm moving the RSS feed to Feedburner later this week (after this post). The new feed will be <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/mdo">http://feeds.feedburner.com/mdo</a>. Feel free to swap the existing feed for this one any time&mdash;it's already up and active with my latest entries.</p>

<p>Sorry for the inconvenience!</p>
