title: Caltrain Doesn't "Get Twitter"
---
<p>Earlier this month Caltrain rolled out it's first official Twitter account, @CTwkendBullets. It's an account just for Caltrain's new weekend bullet trains, and it sends a very clear message: <strong>Caltrain doesn't really get Twitter</strong>.</p>

<h2>About @caltrain</h2>
<p>The @caltrain account was already taken, by a guy named <a href="http://twitter.com/ravipina">Ravi Pina</a>, who just wants to help riders out in their daily commute. It's a community powered account, meaning there are tons of contributors (lowercase c, they don't use the Contributor feature Twitter has) that update the account with changes, delays, and alerts.</p>
<p>Some 5,000 followers get those Tweets, and if all those followers are Caltrain riders, that means roughly 15% of Caltrain's yearly ridership follow the account. That's just amazing.</p>
<p>The service @caltrain provides to others is outstanding and irreplaceable, and most importantly it's something I doubt Caltrain could do right. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, Caltrain likely knows this as well and thus the account is safe for now.</p>

<h2>About @CTwkendBullets</h2>
<p>What a waste&mdash;of time, effort, and any real value to people. The Caltrain riders on Twitter are the ones likely following @caltrain (you typically follow what interests you). If they're already on Twitter, chances are they know how to handle changes in the schedule.</p>
<p>The account breaks down on several levels, but none more apparent than the violently fractured username, "CTwkendBullets." "CT" is an abbreviation for Caltrain, which strangely doesn't need an abbreviation since, you know, it's one word. Even worse, "wkend" gets lost in the middle of capital letters and makes the entire thing very difficult to read.</p>
<p>Rather than try to stuff all that crap in one username, Caltrain should've just gone with CaltrainBullets, which as of writing this post is not taken. It's simple, contains their full brand name, and shows purpose with the username: it's about Caltrain's baby bullet trains.</p>

<h2>How Caltrain should use Twitter</h2>
<p>Caltrain doesn't have the infrastructure or marketing prowess to really use Twitter effectively, but they do have the ability to do something awesome with Twitter. There are a handful of ways to provide value to riders without Tweeting; leave that to the passionate riders and instead focus on adding value.</p>

<h4>Move past the marquee displays at stations</h4>
<p>Nothing shows the service's antiquated ways more than those slow and annoying orange marquee signs at train stops. Most commonly users for showing the time and date, they occasionally show useful information when trains break down and such. Swap those out for real television displays that show the arrival time of the next train and where it stops accompanied by the latest Tweets from @caltrain for riders to connect delayed arrivals with their causes.</p>

<h4>Promote the @caltrain account</h4>
<p>Fast follow, @caltrain, sign up</p>

<h4>Display Tweets on the trains</h4>
<p></p>

<h4>Display Tweets at stations (related to the first???)</h4>
<p></p>

<h4>Bonus: Check into Foursquare, Gowalla, etc for Clipper</h4>
<p></p>

<h4></h4>
