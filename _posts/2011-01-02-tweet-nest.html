<p>I've mentioned <a href="http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/">Tweet Nest</a> before (tweeting about it a few times now), but felt it was worth a full post after I continually find myself going back to it. Until Twitter offers a full archive search, Tweet Nest is the perfect tool to make browsing your old tweets as easy as possible.</p>

<p>According to it's website, Tweet Nest is "a browsable, searchable and easily customizable archive and backup for your tweets" (plus it's open source). You have to setup on your own server to use it, but the setup was easy enough with <a href="http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/#installation">the documentation</a> creator <a href="http://twitter.com/graulund">Andy Graulund</a> has provided.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://markdotto.com/tweets/search?q=tweetnest">setup my own copy of Tweet Nest</a> back in September and have been using it ever since. It's great for looking back in time to find a link I tweeted, some code I mentioned, or an article I linked to. The search isn't too powerful, but it gets the job done. (My only wish is that I had this before I surpassed the Twitter API limi that only lets you retrieve your past 3,500 tweets.)</p>
