title: 3D Text Using Just CSS
---
<p>I have no idea if it's been done before, but I've long wanted to put together a quick little demo showing the power of CSS's <code>text-shadow</code> property. Turns out the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera all render multiple text-shadows on elements, just like <a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/css-boxshadow-experiments">box shadows</a>.</p>

<a href="http://markdotto.com/playground/3d-text/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.markdotto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/3d-text.jpg" alt="3D text using just CSS" style="border-radius: 4px;" /></a>

<p>So I threw this together: 3D text using nothing but CSS. No extra markup, no <code>:before</code> or <code>:after</code> mess, and no images. Just progressively enhancing CSS to add some flair to your work.</p>
