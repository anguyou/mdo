title: Daring Fireball User Style Now on GitHub
---
<p>Just a heads up that I've made my <a href="http://www.markdotto.com/2011/01/01/daring-fireball-user-style/" target="_blank">Daring Fireball user style available on GitHub</a>. Head there for the latest and greatest from here on out. Feel free to fork it with any tweaks you might have, too.</p>

<p><strong>Want to use it now?</strong> Update your user style rules to include an import rule instead of the full-blown CSS I posted previously. It's a compressed version of the CSS, with some additional updates, hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Just copy and paste the code below and you should be all set!</p>

<textarea class="copy-code" rows="1">@import url("http://markdotto.github.com/mdo-df-min.css");</textarea>

<p>Be sure to read <a href="http://www.markdotto.com/2011/01/01/daring-fireball-user-style/">the original blog post</a> I published a week ago that details some of the modifications I've made.</p>

<p>(Hat tip to @kneath for pointing out GitHub Pages.)</p>
