title: Minimizing Distractions
---
Despite owning an iPhone 4 since the middle of last year, I've only just noticed an awesome way Apple minimizes distractions for it's iOS users. Distractions, even things as small as unnecessary "design junk," can keep you from focusing on particular tasks, accomplishing specific goals, and enjoying an otherwise delightful design moment.



	- Minimizing Distractions
		- Distractions in design are self explanatory: they're things that get in your way of accomplishing a task
		- This can include chart junk, ads, upgrade popovers, interstitials, etx
		- In iOS, opening a folder hides the notifications on your apps
		- Sweet because they're big red targets on your screen, even with a translucent black overlay
		- Helps call more attention to what you really want to look at
		- So, what are you doing to minimize distractions in your designs?
