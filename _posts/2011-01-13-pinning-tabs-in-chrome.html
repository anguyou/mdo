title: Pinning Tabs in Chrome
---
<p>Without a doubt the top feature I use in <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> now is the ability to pin tabs in my windows. I like to keep a few websites open all day, and instead of creating Fluid instances for them all, I just pin them.</p>

<p>Here's why you should love them, too:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tabs you like to keep open all the time—like email, streaming media, or news sites—can stay open without interfering in your daily workflow.</li>
	<li>If you quit Chrome with pinned tabs still open, relaunching the app will restore them.</li>
	<li>Pinned tabs help reinforce the policy of having a good favicon that extends your brand so visitors associate the tab with your service.</li>
	<li>You can configure apps from the Chrome Web Store to open as pinned tabs instead of regular tabs.</li>
	<li>And lastly, any tab can be pinned, not just apps&mdash;so go hog wild.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pinned tabs are small and out of the way, but positioned in such a manner that you couldn't miss them when you decide to look for them. It's a nice little value add from the Chrome team and a solid way to keep users engaged with already awesome services like Gmail, Google News, and more.</p>

<p>As a side note, it'll be interesting to see if Firefox or Safari follow suite given the progress Chrome has made in browser share and rapid development pace.</p>
