title: Work Faster with ClipMenu
---
<p>A few months ago I gave up on using <a href="http://www.snippetsapp.com/">Snippets</a>, a great code snippet manager, largely because my free trial ran out and managing a large library of code snippets just didn't appeal to me. Since then, I've grown accustomed to working (and playing) a bit differently thanks to two changes to my workflow, one of which was installing <a href="http://www.clipmenu.com/">ClipMenu</a>.</p>

<p>ClipMenu is a sweet application that expands the capabilities of OS X's default copy and paste to include copy history and, yes, snippets. But that's not the best part; it also includes a contextual menu that you can summon anywhere and anytime with a global shortcut. Badass.</p>

<p>I use ClipMenu for a few purposes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Copying several things in a row, then retrieving them from the history (max 20 items)</li>
	<li>Storing links to videos and images I frequently use</li>
	<li>Storing code snippets like CSS3 properties, base HTML, and even unicode character identities</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, development seems to be stalled. The latest tweets from @clipmenu and the app's creator @naotakaM on Twitter were from May of 2010. That said, the app is wonderfully simplistic and I haven't encountered any bugs. It works great and has ever since I installed it.</p>

<p>Like what you see? <a href="http://www.clipmenu.com">Give it a download</a>. You might be interested in <a href="http://www.markdotto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/StatusMenuIcon.png">my customized menu bar icon</a> which hollows out the clipboard icon to lighten up it's presence in the menu bar.</p>

<p>(Oh, and the second change was moving to <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less CSS</a> to add variables, mixins, and more to my CSS.)</p>
