title: One Year at Twitter
---
<p>Today marks the one year anniversary of working as a designer at Twitter. The only thing that I can say about it is <em>holy shit</em>. 2010 came and went faster than any other year I can recall. It was full of awesome events, people, and projects, and 2011 is shaping up to be even better.</p>

<p>When I started we had less than 140 employees, the design team was 6 people strong, we were on one floor in our building, had a different CEO, and our Promoted Products were just getting started. Flash forward to today and we have 10 people on the design team intermingled with over 350 employees on two floors, a new CEO, and three types of Promoted Products.</p>

<p>I'm pretty stoked for the next year. I'm looking forward to hunkering down with the rest of the revenue team to continue to iterate on and refine our products, <a href="http://twitter.com/job.html?jvi=oUkkVfwd,Job">growing the design team</a>, and making Twitter more awesome than it is today.</p>
