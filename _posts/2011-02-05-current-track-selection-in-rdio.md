title: Current track selection in Rdio
---
<p>Alright, so it's no secret that I freaking love Rdio. After Twitter, it's the greatest service that I've ever usedâ€”period. Discovery of music, universal access, and a pretty awesome design have made it a dream come to for music afficionados.</p>

<p>If I had to name one gripe though it'd be no clear song selection in playlists, collections, or albums on the Web version. It's incredibly difficult to find the track you're currently listening to so you can add it to your collection, another playlist, or sync it to your mobile.</p>

<p>The only place you can currently see the selection is in the queue modal, but I hardly ever think to venture there to find out. Instead, I'm forced to use the Find feature in my browser. Not very intuitive unfortunately.</p>

<p>Make that track stand out so I can fly through lengthy playlists and albums and find exactly what I need. That, or give me a contextual menu in the player itself:</p>
