title: "The cure for information overload: less information"
---
I know what you're thinkingâ€”"Less information? Are you kidding me?" Well, no, I'm not. The fact is there is a lot of awesome stuff on the Web. It's be produced by the bucket and a lot of it is really good, but there's plenty out there that is utter shit.

So, I say again, the cure for information overload is less information.
