title: Your Two Cents
---
<p>Your two cents aren't the same <em>my</em> two cents. <strong>Nope, not even close.</strong> Your two cents afford you nothing but a false sense of security and ultimately do little for whatever it is your opinion might be. And you know why that is?</p>

<p>It's because I don't tell you that it's my two cents&mdash;<em>I just say it</em>.</p>

<p>Share your ideas, ask the questions that need to be asked, and build a culture that embraces the thoughts of others. Don't append your comments with hollow words like "Just my 2 cents" that do little more than make you look timid and fearful of sharing your true thoughts or stand up for what you believe in.</p>

<p>Be bold, be honest, and be straightforward. Have conviction, question the status quo, challenge authority, put yourself out there because no one else is going to. We need people like you to speak your mind loud and clear.</p>

<p>Because chances are <strong>you have ideas</strong> the rest of us don't.</p>
