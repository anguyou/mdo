title: Less Complaining, More Sexy Rumpus
---
Social services like Twitter and Dribbble mirror the real life relationships we have with other people. If I like what you have to say, what you do, or what you care about, I might "follow" you. It's not always this black and white, but this model is the basis for nearly every relationship I have in the real world and online.

Twitter, Dribbble, and the like are what you make them. They're not the same for everyone as people will use a tool or service for whatever use case they see fit. I use Twitter to follow designers, my girlfriend uses it for following the news and our friends. I use Dribbble to share ideas, more polished projects, and to consume as much awesomeness as I can as a means of inspiration.

Dribbble is very much like Twitter. It shares the same follow/follower model, but in a more focused application: sharing what you're working on as a designer. it can be fonts, icons, wallpapers, interfaces, sketches, photographs, illustrations, and more. W

Social media is what you make of it
You can lurk or engage at your own will
You can follow and be followed by whomever you wish
That relationship makes whatever social site you belong to completely in your hands
Fretting about what others do with it isn't productive, effective, or useful
People will use a tool or service for whatever use case they want
  - for me: twitter connects me with other designers across the world, gives me conversations with them; dribbble gets me (limited) feedback from peers
Experimentation—pushing the bounds of a tool or service is great—I encourage anyone to do it
  - but you have to account for certain reactions
  - meeting those reactions with nothing more than bile won't get you anywhere
  - personally attacking a single person or a community is backlash
People get so attached to their community and their work that they can't stay emotionally detached from it
  - don't get caught up in your work
  - remain subjective
  - expect criticism
