<p>For the last several months, I've been developing websites and apps with an awesome tool called <a href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">LESS</a>. It's a CSS preprocessor that sits on top of regular ol' CSS, but provides a ton of extra features like mixins, variables, functions, and operations. The best part? It all comes out as compressed, locally-stored CSS. Hotness, right?</p>

<p>Well, when I started using LESS at Twitter to create Blueprint&mdash;a CSS and HTML framework that helps our engineers quickly developer Twittery apps&mdash;I realized I needed a starter file of sorts to house all my variables and simple mixins. As time went out, that file grew and has since become the soul of every project I work on, including this very website.</p>

<p>Today, I'm releasing a modified version of that file and it's called <a href="http://markdotto.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>. Bootstrap is a super awesome pack of mixins and variables to be used in conjunction with LESS in any of your web projects. It immediately makes any new design or development project <em>that</em> much easier to start, and also makes older projects easier to maintain.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I plan on adding more to Bootstrap with additional mixins, variables, and such. I'm also considering making Bootstrap part of several larger projects that I hope to release over the next few months. More on those things to come soon enough!</p>

<p>For now, <a href="http://markdotto.com/bootstrap">visit the Bootstrap website</a> to find out more. You can <a href="https://github.com/markdotto/Bootstrap.less">download or fork it at GitHub</a>. Questions, comments, or suggestions? Email me.</p>
