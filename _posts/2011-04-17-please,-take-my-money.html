title: Please, Take My Money

<p>Today I went to Subway to pick up a quick lunch&mdash;I got a foot-long steak combo with chips and a drink. When I got to the end of the line, I saw the cookies and I thought to myself, "Hell yeah I'm getting cookies!" Having only glanced at the cookie container as I approached, I asked for some chocolate chip cookies.</p>

<p>"We're out, sold them to a bunch of kids right before you," the guy says as he starts to look a bit annoyed.</p>

<p>"Wow, nice&mdash;good problem to have, huh?" I say back. As a guy who loves to eat cookies, I'm thinking this is a great problem to have; people want what this guy has and he can't keep up with demand.</p>

<p>"Nope, <em>now</em> I gotta make more." he replies grimly.</p>

<p>"Well yeah, but it's better than having them all and no one buying, right?"</p>

<p>"No, now I have to make more." He pauses and sighs. I back down and just hand him my debit card.</p>

<p>Ignoring the fact that I was at Subway, the moral of the story is this guy&mdash;who always looks rundown and irritated when I stop in&mdash;is pretty upset that he has to do a bit of work to take more money from customers. It's such a small problem in the grand scheme of things, but it was clearly bringing this guy down.</p>

<p>If you're going to be all pissy about people wanting what you're selling, you're doing it wrong.</p>
