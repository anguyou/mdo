title: Write less Less
---
<p>I've written about using <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a> before, touting the benefits of accelerating development and simplifying CSS. It seems the more I use it, the more awesome things I have to say about it. It adds many great features to regular CSS like variables, mixins, and nesting, but it's the latter that that I want to talk about more today.</p>

<p>While I've written about <a href="http://www.markdotto.com/2011/01/29/an-update-on-less-js-nesting-your-css/">using nesting in LESS</a> before, turns out it can encourage good and bad practices as a web developer. Nesting is great, but not if you're just adding bloat to your code. Take for instance this snippet of LESS:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
header {
  ul {
    li {
      a {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>When compiled, it looks like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
header ul li a {
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>So, what's the problem? Looks fine at first, right? Well, not so much. You can actually improve this quite a lot by simplifying the nesting, thereby decreasing the amount of code, rendering time, file size, and most importantly specificity. With CSS, I've found you need to strike a balance between writing very generic code and writing very durable and modular code. Specificity as a result of nesting has a direct impact on both of those things.</p>

<p>Taking that same LESS code from above and rewriting it to not use unecessary parents in our selectors shows how we can attempt to get closer to achieving that balance.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
header {
  ul { ... }
  li { ... }
  a { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>Of course it depends on your markup and your needs, but this is the gist of what I'm getting at. <strong>Ultimately this isn't a LESS-specific problem;</strong> anyone coding CSS can run into this, but with LESS it becomes easier to do unintentionally.</p>

<p>Don't nest just to nest. Nest to simplify your final, compiled CSS. You'll save code and headaches later on.</p>
