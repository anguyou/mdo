title: Updated site design
---
Decided to give the site a little update by realigning the design. Not much has changed, so here's the gist:

- Streamlined everything by moving to a single column
- Sidebar is gone, peep the footer
- Open Sans, baby (served via Google Web Fonts)
- Updated photo of me to match my avatar elsewhere
- Less PHP, JS, HTML, and CSS

And that's about it. Shed 20 pounds visually and another 10 under the hood. Feels great. Hope you like it!
