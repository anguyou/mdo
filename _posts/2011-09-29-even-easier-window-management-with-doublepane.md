title: Even easier window management with DoublePane
---
After I had been [using Divvy](http://www.markdotto.com/2011/06/07/better-faster-mac-window-management-with-divvy/) for awhile, I was pointed to DoublePane by a coworker. The app, made by [5am Code](http://5amcode.com/), is essentially the barebones version of Divvy, adding only four simple keyboards shortcut to resize windows.

- <abbr>Ctrl + Opt + &larr;</abbr> to cover the left 50% of your screen
- <abbr>Ctrl + Opt + &rarr;</abbr> to cover the right 50% of your screen
- <abbr>Ctrl + Opt + &uarr;</abbr> to maximize the window
- <abbr>Ctrl + Opt + &darr;</abbr> to go back to the original, non-resized via DoublePane, window size

What's awesome about DoublePane is that I had been using [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/), a more expensive ($14) and feature-rich app, to do basically the same thing with it's custom keyboard shortcut functionality. DoublePane was just another way to do that and only $3 in the Mac App Store, so I opted for that one.

[Check it out](http://5amcode.com/) and see if it suites your needs.
