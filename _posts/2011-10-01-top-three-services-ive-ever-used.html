title: Top three services I've ever used
---
Subjective as all hell, but no matter: there are three services I've used in my life that are by far the best out there. Three services that have made my life easier, happier, and more awesome simply because they exist and I can use them daily without any friction.

## Twitter

Without a doubt the most important in my line of work (aside from being a designer there, that is). Without [Twitter](http://twitter.com), I wouldn't have a sweet job, wouldn't have gotten to know dozens of awesome people, and wouldn't have the pleasure of using a service that connects me to an infinite set of people, topics, and news. It amazes me every day through and through.

## Rdio

Holy moly, [Rdio](http://rdio.com) has some sweet tunes. I used to lug around a 100+ GB iTunes library like a noob, but now I carry around a Mac app, website, and/or iPhone app like a boss. Streaming, syncing, and a bitching design makes me a happy camper.

I can't tell you enough how important music is to what I do. Without it, I lack focus and energy to burn through important tasks. As I sit here busting through a realigned website and writing my fifth blog post of the day, it's just downright essential. And when essential stuff like music is done right like Rdio, its magic, baby.

## GitHub

I have been tooting my horn for [GitHub](http://github.com) a lot lately, but it's with damn good reason. Development, aside from HTML and CSS, was never my strongest skill, but that changed after using GitHub.

Without GitHub, I wouldn't be able to host, iterate, and manage a project like Bootstrap. It's set of tools--code hosting, issue tracking, wiki, and more--make it the most versatile remote code service I've ever used. Plus, it's purdy to look at and a joy to use.

Not all services get me excited to keep using them, but these three do everyday. It's amazing what a well-design tool can do for solving a particular need and providing a positive experience at the same time. Be mindful of these kinds of services--they're rather rare and generously awesome.
