[GitHub](https://github.com) is awesome, amazing, and wonderful. It's one of the best things that has ever happened to me as a designer and developer. However, I find myself distracted by the background images and styles of the topbar and struggle to skim boatloads of issues on [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/). So, I added a custom userstyle in Chrome to help me out.

## The userstyle

The header and body changes are purely cosmetic changes based on personal preference, but the change to the issues list helps me work a bit more efficiently on Bootstrap. I hide who submitted the issue and when and unbold the issue names. This way I can see more issues at once and get a larger, bird's eye view.

## Updated topbar

## Download on GitHub

[Check it out](https://gist.github.com/1308455) and fork it on [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com) if you like.

*If you're using Google Chrome, I recommend using [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) to add userstyles. For Safari, I recommend [User CSS](http://code.grid.in.th/).*
