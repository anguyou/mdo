  <blockquote>
    <p>Believe in your fucking self. Stay up all fucking night. Work outside of your fucking habits. Know when to fucking speak up. Fucking collaborate. Don't fucking procrastinate. Get over your fucking self. Keep fucking learning. Form follows fucking function. A computer is a Lite-Brite for bad fucking ideas. Find fucking inspiration everywhere. Fucking network. Educate your fucking client. Trust your fucking gut. Ask for fucking help. Make it fucking sustainable. Question fucking everything. Have a fucking concept. Learn to take some fucking criticism. Make me fucking care. Use fucking spell check. Do your fucking research. Sketch more fucking ideas. The problem contains the fucking solution. Think about all the fucking possibilities.</p>

Just bought this poster from [Good Fucking Design Advice](http://goodfuckingdesignadvice.com/) in [black on fucking black](http://goodfuckingdesignadvice.bigcartel.com/product/black-on-fucking-black-poster). It shall serve as a solid reality check everyday once I get it framed and hung. Love it.
