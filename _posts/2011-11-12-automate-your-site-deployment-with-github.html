title: Automate your site deployment with GitHub
---
After posting about my process for remotely hosting and deploying my personal site's codebase on GitHub, I was informed you can automate the process via service hooks. That means version control and site deployment is even easier than before.

Mark Christian, a beloved coworker of mine at Twitter, wrote a [quick post summarizing the process](http://writing.markchristian.org/how-to-deploy-your-code-from-github-automatic). The gist is you modify your repository's admin section to add a service hook. That way, when you push new code to GitHub, it automatically executes a script on your server to pull the code down.

I'll be giving this a try soon to see how it works out as a process for me (I usually prefer the control of manual deployment), but it sounds awesome.

[Check it out](http://writing.markchristian.org/how-to-deploy-your-code-from-github-automatic) and show [Mr. Christian](http://twitter.com/shinypb) some love on Twitter if you like what you see.
