If you didn't have a chance to make it out to last week's event, you can view the slides on [Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com) from [our Bootstrap 2 announcement](http://speakerdeck.com/u/mdo/p/bootstrap-2) at Twitter HQ. In our presentation, Jacob and I walked through a brief update and history of Bootstrap, some of the new hotness in v2, and a quick look at the future of the toolkit. Also, be sure to check out the slides from [Rob Sayre](https://twitter.com/sayrer)'s [Hogan.js talk](http://speakerdeck.com/u/sayrer/p/hoganjs) and [Sean Herron](https://twitter.com/seanherron)'s [NASA &amp; Open Source talk](http://speakerdeck.com/u/seanherron/p/opennasa-twitter-open-source-summit).

Thanks again to all those who made it out, helped test [Bootstrap 2](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and contributed to the project. We couldn't do it without you nerds!
