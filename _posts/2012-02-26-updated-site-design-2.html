title: Updated site design
---
Last night I pushed a few updates to the site to refine the design and keep the focus on the content:

- Increased font-size and line-height from 15px/24 to 16px/28
- Ported in the latest `code` and `pre` styles from Bootstrap 2
- Moved the Fusions Ads from the left of posts to the far right of the page
- Moved the Tweet button from the right of posts to in the flow of the content (like I already do on narrow viewports)

I've also updated the masthead to decrease the size of my picture, include some additional links, and update the text to match my Twitter bio. It bring the content farther up and simplifies the overall presentation.

Enjoy!
