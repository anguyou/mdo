Writing about simplicity is difficult. It's tough to not sound egregiously grandiose or obnoxiously obvious, but sometimes we all need that. And right now, I need that, if only for my own sanity.

**Everything needs to be fucking simpler.**

This manifests itself in a number of ways, none more apparent to me than in interface and product design. Consider how many successful products you use that focus on one amazing *thing*: Byword, Dropbox, Rdio, Uber. All these products and their interfaces are the result of paring down an idea to only the most essential. People love this stuff.

We want&mdash;need?&mdash;fewer, higher quality *things* in our lives. We crave simpler at every turn. As designers we can provide that.
